# Privacy Policy — Sift

**Effective date:** 2025-11-24

**Developer:** TJ Spuzello  
**App:** Sift  
**Contact:** https://x.com/SiftAppiOS

## Summary
Sift stores grocery lists that you create in your personal iCloud account using Apple CloudKit. Sift does not collect personal information for analytics, advertising, or third-party sharing. No data collected by Sift is transmitted to external parties beyond Apple’s iCloud service used to store your lists.

## What information we collect
- **User-provided content:** Sift stores lists and list items that you create within the app. These items are stored in your personal iCloud / CloudKit container.
- **No other collection:** Sift does not collect contacts, location, photos, camera or microphone data, payment details, or health information. Sift does not include analytics, ad SDKs, or third-party trackers.

## How information is used
- The lists you create are stored in iCloud so they can be synchronized across devices signed in with the same Apple ID. This enables you to view and edit lists across your devices.
- We do not analyze, sell, or otherwise share your list content with third parties.

## Where data is stored
- Your list data is stored in your Apple iCloud account via CloudKit. Apple handles the hosting and storage of that data.
- Data is stored in Apple’s infrastructure. Retention is controlled by the presence of the records in your iCloud account and any deletion actions you or the app perform.

## Security
- Data stored via CloudKit benefits from Apple’s platform security, including in-transit and at-rest protections provided by Apple.
- We do not implement additional end-to-end encryption beyond the protections provided by Apple’s iCloud/CloudKit service.

## Who is responsible (data controller)
- **Developer / Controller:** [Your Developer/Legal Name] ([contact@example.com]) is the controller of user data for Sift, to the extent required by applicable law. Apple acts as the data processor for data stored in iCloud/CloudKit.

## International distribution and data protection
- Sift is distributed in [United States]. If you download or use Sift from other countries, your information may be transferred to, stored, and processed in the United States or by Apple locations as required to provide iCloud services.

## Children
- Sift is intended for adult use and not directed to children under applicable age thresholds (for example, under 13 in the United States). If you believe a child under the appropriate age has provided personal data to Sift, please contact us at [contact@example.com].

## Your rights and choices
Depending on where you live, you may have rights regarding your personal data, including:
- Request access to or a copy of your data.
- Ask for corrections or deletion of your data (note: deletion will remove data from your iCloud/CloudKit records).
- Object to or restrict processing where applicable.

To exercise rights, email us at [contact@example.com]. We will respond according to applicable law.

## Opt-outs and app-level controls
- Sift does not perform behavioral tracking or targeted advertising. There are no in-app controls required for tracking.
- To remove data created in Sift, delete the lists within the app; this removes the corresponding records from your iCloud/CloudKit storage.

## Third-party services
- The only third-party service involved is Apple iCloud/CloudKit for storage and synchronization. Consult Apple’s privacy documentation for details about Apple’s handling of iCloud data.

## Changes to this policy
We may update this policy from time to time. We will post the revised policy at this same URL with an updated effective date.
